# About ScaleScience

ScaleScience is a comprehensive fish weight calculator application available for iOS, macOS, and watchOS. Using scientifically-validated length-weight relationships from FishBase 2025 and IGFA world records, ScaleScience provides accurate weight estimates for fish based on length and girth measurements.

The app is backed by extensive fisheries data analysis from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), including 74 years of historical catch data (1950-2023) and population biomass estimates for major commercial species.

## Our Goals

- Provide accurate, science-based fish weight estimates for anglers, researchers, and fisheries professionals
- Support sustainable fisheries management through data-driven insights
- Make complex fisheries data accessible through intuitive applications
- Expand species coverage to include both saltwater and freshwater fish globally
- Contribute to fisheries conservation and research

---

## Species Coverage

ScaleScience currently supports **126 fish species** including:

### Major Tunas (7 species)
- **Bluefin Tuna (BFT)** - Atlantic Bluefin
- **Yellowfin Tuna (YFT)**
- **Albacore (ALB)**
- **Skipjack Tuna (SKJ)**
- **Bigeye Tuna (BET)**
- **Atlantic Bonito (BON)**
- **Little Tunny (LTA)**

### Billfishes (3 species)
- **Swordfish (SWO)**
- **Blue Marlin (BUM)**
- Additional billfish species

### Sharks (4 species)
- **Blue Shark (BSH)**
- **Shortfin Mako (SSM)**

### Other Species (100+ species)
- **King Mackerel (KGM)**
- **Frigate Tuna (FRI)**
- Additional commercial and recreational species
- Global freshwater and saltwater species

All species data includes:
- Length-weight allometric parameters (W = a Ã— L^b)
- IGFA world records (length, girth, weight)
- Both metric (kg, cm) and imperial (lbs, inches) units
- Girth-based field formulas where available

## ICCAT Fisheries Data Analysis

ScaleScience is built on rigorous analysis of publicly available fisheries data from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). This research includes:

### Data Coverage
- **74 years of historical catch data** (1950-2023)
- **126 species** globally (15 major ICCAT species analyzed in depth)
- **20-year catch predictions** (2024-2043)
- **Population biomass estimates** (2023)
- **Regional distribution analysis** across Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea

### Key Findings
- **Total Atlantic Biomass** (15 major species): 2.99 million tonnes
- **Overall Exploitation Rate**: 24.9% (sustainable)
- **Success Story**: Atlantic Bluefin Tuna showing strong recovery through quota management
- **Conservation Priorities**: Shark species requiring continued protection

### Methodologies
- Prophet time-series forecasting
- Multi-factor predictive models (15 enhancement factors)
- Exploitation rate inverse calculations
- FishBase 2025 allometric parameters
- IGFA world record integration

### Applications in ScaleScience
The ICCAT analysis informs our species parameters, weight-length relationships, and provides scientific validation for our calculation methods. This ensures ScaleScience delivers accurate, research-backed estimates for anglers and fisheries professionals.
