            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 14, 2025</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>ScaleScience (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) respects your privacy. This policy explains how the ScaleScience applications and website handle information, the limited data they collect, and the choices available to you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>This policy covers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ScaleScience native applications for Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS).</li>
                <li>The ScaleScience web tools hosted at <a href="https://www.scalescience.us.kg">www.scalescience.us.kg</a>, including the privacy page available at <a href="https://www.scalescience.us.kg/privacy">/privacy</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>On-Device Calculator Data</h3>
            <p>The ScaleScience applications perform fish weight projections entirely on your device. Length, girth, species selections, and computed results stay on the device and are not transmitted to us or third parties.</p>

            <h3>Account and Identity Information</h3>
            <p>We do not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or supply any personally identifying information to use ScaleScience. We do not collect names, contact details, government identifiers, or biometric data.</p>

            <h3>Analytics and Telemetry</h3>
            <p>The ScaleScience native applications do not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising networks, or trackers. App Store analytics that Apple provides to developers are aggregated and do not identify you personally.</p>

            <h3>Website Logs</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, our hosting provider automatically records standard server logs (for example, IP address, browser type, the page requested, and time of request). We use these logs solely for security, troubleshooting, and evaluating site performance. Logs are retained for no longer than 30 days unless needed to investigate abuse.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To operate, maintain, and secure the ScaleScience applications and website.</li>
                <li>To respond to inquiries you choose to send us.</li>
                <li>To comply with legal obligations or protect our rights, users, or the public.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We never sell user data, and we do not share personal information with advertisers or data brokers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share personally identifying information because we do not collect it. If you contact us, the contents of your message may be routed through our email or issue tracking service providers solely so we can respond. We may disclose information if required by law or to enforce our agreements and policies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>

                <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> Measurement inputs and calculator outputs remain on your device until you clear them or uninstall the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> Any communication you send us is retained only for as long as needed to address your request and maintain records of our correspondence.</li>
                <li><strong>Server logs:</strong> Automatically collected website logs are deleted within 30 days unless required for security investigations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>

                <li>You may opt not to submit any personal information to us; the app functions fully without it.</li>
                <li>If you contact us, you may request that we delete your message history and we will do so unless we must retain it for legal reasons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have additional rights regarding access to or deletion of personal information. Contact us and we will help facilitate those rights.</p>

            <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
            <p>ScaleScience is designed for adult professionals and recreational anglers. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age (or the minimum age applicable in your jurisdiction).
